== Development

All is generated in the `build/docs/asciidoc` directory. The `index.html` file is the main entry point.
You need to have the following tools installed:

- Java 17
- Python
- NodeJS. You need to install mermaid-cli globally with `npm install -g mermaid.cli` to use the `[mermaid]` macro to generate diagrams.
